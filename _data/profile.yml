  Hello, I am a second-year M.S. student at Chung-Ang University, advised by Prof. Hak Gu Kim in the <a href="https://www.irislab.cau.ac.kr/" target="_blank">IRIS Lab</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  As a researcher specializing in adversarial attacks, my primary focus is on developing robust adversarial attack techniques for 3D data. Specifically, my research interests include: (i) <b>3D adversarial attacks using text</b>, and (ii) <b>adversarial attacks through deformation.</b>
  </p>
  <p>
  Recently, I have been particularly interested in exploring 3D adversarial attacks through deformation combined with text-based inputs.
